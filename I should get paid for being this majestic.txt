As I queue here at the bank, 
my mind goes wand'ring like the tank
that, stolen, rampaged San Diego, 
mashed some cars like baked potatos,
knocked down poles and fire hydrants, 
back in 1995.

The thief, they said a jobless plumber,
grabbed the craft and pulled a runner
down the streets ignoring traffic,
smashing, crashing, wreaking havoc,
to run amok ignoring sirens
on the last day of his life.

So, anyway, I stand and wait,
and as I do I contemplate
the lives of pop stars and their capers
that get their names in all the papers.

And while I'm standing here line, 
it seems to me that Michael Jackson
dangling his baby Blanket 
from the balcony on four
did not ever stop to think 
about all of the media stink
at little Jr on the brink
of reaching abruptly the floor.

<end>

I sit here eating a burrito, 
wondering why it looks pink.
My stomach churns, I feel uneasy. 
Suddenly extremely queasy,
I barely make it, not so easy, 
to throw it all up in the sink.

<end>

Two monkeys dance a wild tango
'round the jungle, hither yon,
together faster than they can go
alone through the Amazon.
They crash right through some prickly bushes,
gallup off a precipice.
Sprawling, falling, cold wind rushes
in their ears, all hope is gone.
They should have looked where they were going,
but the monkeys won't be missed.

<end>
