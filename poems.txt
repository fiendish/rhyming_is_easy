left: NoStanding.jpg
The signs say no standing on poles down the street.
But standing means sitting in the driver's seat.
The rule's against cars occupying the road,
not humans on legs in a statuesque mode.
It tells of the car's, not the driver's position.
And stopping your wheels needs D.O.T.'s permission.

===
top: BrushPlugs.jpg[600]
In the museum surrounded by glass,
eight solid pillars for plugging your ass. (hah)
Set upon boxes, their polished grain surfaces
softly betray vaguely inhumane purposes.
Gentle sloped curves with their bases cut flush,
spiked tips observed to be shaped like a brush.
Grind them down, maybe, then wear them with pride,
but as they are, baby, they'll stab you inside.
===
left: PettingZoo.jpg
In the museum for mostly wood art
where the work's fragile and may fall apart
there is a wheeled little grey metal cart
known as the petting zoo of extra parts.
Well, they are mostly wood, obviously.
There are some golden bits, as you can see.
Even the least creative attendee
knows that brass fasteners come from a tree.

left: EasternStateExerciseYard.jpg
Between wire, brick, and stone
exercise yards, overgrown,
cell nearby for Al Capone,
population not well known,
praying Jews could feel at home
in a place to call their own,
lit by lights that say "shalom",
thus describes the guide headphone.
===
left: TrashStrike.jpg
City workers went on strike,
told the mayor "take a hike".
All the neighborhoods were like,
"Hey, we're kinda mad now."

No waste pickup for a week,
dumpsters placed that all may seek.
Populace chimes in critique,
"We don't want to scab now."

Garbage bringers come at night,
stacking trash bags to great height,
shyly slinging by moonlight,
noting, "Smells real bad now."

After time the union kneels.
City hall curbed their appeals.
Said about the whole ordeal,
"Budget's ironclad now."
===
left: FineSign.jpg
"Smoking, vaping, fare evasion,
if you're seen, can lead to fines."
Antisocial act dissuasion
on a brightly colored sign.

White on red to get attention
from the riders of the train.
The specific law is mentioned,
so if caught you can't complain.

No words, though, on urination.
Maybe that means it's okay.
Pee all over the train station
without getting locked away.

(no photo, at the bar, next to a young...couple)

Golden hair, and golden rings, and arms and legs adorned with ink.
Rapid fire fingers flick an endless travel photo stream.
Also endless monologue; never pauses, never breathes.
Boyfriend isn't even looking, just keeps pawing at her knee.

The boyfriend's definitely bored.
He clearly is not interested.
He's looking at the Phillies' score
on his feed from Insta instead.
===
left: Blower.mp4
Lots of noise and lots of dust.
Ineffective 'lectric gusts.
Gathering debris like this?
Gonna be a while at it.
For an hour walk around.
Sweeping would be done by now.
Across the park I watch and sit
and listen to your coughing fit.
You should wear a mask, dude.
Inhaling that is bad for you.

The tidied common sure is nice though.
Is this your job or do you live close?
===
top: GlassyEyes.jpg[600]
I'm walking down the street reading a book about delight.
While aiming at my feet, my eyes detect a creepy sight.
I've passed a thousand times before but never once could see
the frosted steps beneath this door are looking back at me.
===
top: Scraps.jpg[600]
Little happy face is made of scraps from off my plate.
Mini grin was hiding in the bits I nearly ate.
Everything's in place if you just shift your mental state.
A tiny briny beaming sunny smile incarnate.
===
top: Ficus.jpg[600]
It is funny that most ficus make a fig you should not eat,
like a photo of an ice cube in the searing summer heat.
It reminds you of the nice fruit filled with gobs of tiny seeds,
but most fruiting feral ficus lack the sugar to be sweet.

So if you pass a planter when you're walking down the street,
and you think, "If that were edible, it truly would be neat,"
best evaluate assumptions about visual deceit;
almost certainly its species isn't gonna be a treat.
===
left: Asteraceae.jpg
This flower has small flowers.
Apparently that's a thing?
The center cluster makes the disc
with rays encircling.

The head is a capitulum,
a compositional set
of many tiny blooms in one,
each piece called a floret.

They present as one entity
seen better from afar.
Members of Asteraceae,
a family of stars.
===
left: AlteredSign.jpg
Do you ever look at a sign on a pole
and think, "Can anyone do that?
Can I grant myself the rulemaker's role
and alter the content or format?"

Because, sometimes, the signs, you see,
are doctored, and it's not clear whether
the change was made officially
or by a neighbor feeling clever.
===
top: CacklingSun.jpg[500]
The cackling sun melts the sky.
The exhausted earth heaves, unwilling, out of breath.
And the people under parasols crawl from shadow to furious shadow, asking why,
as the conflagration of a midsummer's day offers sweltering death.

The cats twitch in dream as passersby
peer longingly at the windowsills where they ignore the street.
A lone man smears salty rivers of sweat into his eyes,
thirsting for conditioned interlude from this murderous heat.

"A cloud, a cloud, oh thank you, a cloud",
weary walkers, prostrating themselves to cumulus change,
stare into the glare and declare to their friends out loud,
newly prepared for hopefully impending rain.
===
left: SuctionTool.jpg
Light suction to mosquito bite.
This tubular tool's neato, right?
White plastic itch torpedo's might
will help you get to sleep tonight.
===
left: NotDedicated.jpg
Can something be dedicated not dedicated?
Is the declaration not designation?
Is the determination not a demonstration?

Does undedication deem it deprecated?
Is its detraction not debilitation?
Does diminution not display disinclination?

Is disclosure on its face disseminated?
Is its denunciation not defamation?
Are we discouraged by its desecration?

If it's not dedicated, what is it?
===
left: Puffball.jpg
Pink petaled prickly purpurea,
perimeter prostrated pendulously.
Spiny center starkly solid,
stickers stiffly stab at me.

Pretty puffball pretends plushness,
possesses piercing pointed pikes.
Seemingly supple, shards surprising,
startling stilettos, secret spikes.
===
top: Bubbles.mp4[450]
Atomized aromatics animatedly arise all a-twitter,
alchemical amber alike to autumn.

Billowing bubbles blossom in brassy bitter,
buzzing, bursting, boiling from bottom.

Carbonation climbs and coalesces to creamy chitter,
a clinging, crackling, crown of cotton.

Glass of nostalgia, sensorial memory transmitter,
forever in mind and heart, never forgotten.
===
top: Serenade.jpg[600]
After the park
one weekend, lazy
dog walk, light beers, Chinese food.
Guitar in hand,
you serenade me
to keep away shared solitude.
===

In a window
down the block
past the kids with
sidewalk chalk,
cat with languor,
eartip cut,
dark tabby fur,
named Peanut.
===
left: BeckSecond.jpg
At a corner on my walk,
a geographic marker beckoned.
Letters carved in cement block,
I see the cross streets "Beck" and "Second".
===
left: Pareidolia.jpg
Pareidolia, in this place,
made from metal stars and pipes.
If I told ya' it's a face,
you'd agree that I am right.
How we see it, who can say.
Maybe it's a trick of light.

or Maybe our brains work this way
to Dodge the wall man's slanted bite.
===
left: TinyBugs.jpg
Hidden microscopic bugs
eating holes in all the leaves.
I hope they don't invade my hugs
and give me itchy tickly sleeves.

Does the plant mind, do you think,
that it's riddled full of dots?
Or does it yearn for insect friends
and know the bugs must love it lots?
===
left: MetalCat.jpg
Metal cat, metal cat, 
what the heck you staring at
perched high up the 'lectric pole
in a fetching turquoise stole?

Trees behind you show right through 
your body made of curlicues.
I wish you looked down at the street 
I like your face more than your feet.
===
left: NightHatDark.jpg
Near South and Broad there is a wall
of Mural Arts causation.
A lion's face, a drill, a clock,
a scroll of divination.

The I Ching runs behind a wheel
and passersby can reach and spin
to let the future unconceal
the best way for them to begin.

We stop, we read, we make our bets
about which guidance we'll each get.
I spin it thrice, and, at the mark,
I hit the night, the hat, the dark.
===
left: AllCallsFree.jpg
Come learn about economics,
gender norms, and microphonics,
books, zines, wires, and anarchy.

Not questionable, Iffy.

Call whomever, share the glee,
their payphone says, laconically,
projecting generosity:

"Donations only. All calls free."

top: Speckles1.jpg[230], Speckles2.jpg[230], Speckles3.jpg[230]
Sun-sprinkled scintillant speckles strewn astride a shining grin.
Dazzling dancing diaphanous freckles dot your delicate dappled skin.
Laughing eyes behind dark glasses gaze at me uncertainly
and curiously try to assess what it is that my eyes see.

I see the sunlight singing songs of praise. 
It shines signs on your face, "Good morning. Happy Birthday."
===
left: ArthurOnTheStairs.jpg
My cat's a little dummy,
brain squishy like a gummy.
He's got a fluffy tummy,
but
his hearing's pretty crummy.

Half way up the staircase, he
calls out loud to locate me.
So I walk over to see
the cause of his crying plea.

When I say his name, he
looks the wrong way and sees
no one at the top and
thinks he just can't see me.

Then I call him again, and he swings his head around,
sees me standing on the landing nearer to the ground,
looks back up and then back down again until his eyes
recognize my visage which he notes with some surprise.

His face lights up, "Oh, hey! You're there!
How'd you get past me on the stairs?
I heard you up, but now you're down.
I guess my senses turned around!"

I say "I know, there's no brain there.
Your head is filled with fluff and air.
It makes you super sweet and true.
It's ok though, I love you too."
===
left: StonePolarbears.jpg
A park to the north is just one tree and shrubs,
a quiet side alley away from the clubs
where people can sit with Italian subs
defending the street from stone polarbear cubs.
===
left: CatHouse.jpg
A lodge for the cat who's alone on the street
and looking for shelter or a place to eat
that's out of harm's way and not under our feet
with shade to keep cool from the summer sun's heat.

The neighborhood felines that live on our blocks,
the grey one, the tabby, the black one with socks,
when resting protected and not out on walks,
might come spend their nights in this covered cat box.
===

On first week and third, Friday from 9AM,
from March thru December, they streetsweep again.
Then Monday thru Wednesday and Thursday thru Sat,
you've got max 2 hours, I'm sorry, that's that.
But also you're NEVER allowed, so think twice!
Except Permit 7, I guess. Must be nice.
===

Please fly here post haste with your hydrate applier!
A spark has ignited in my lint-clogged dryer!
Don air tanks and facemasks to safely respire,
and helmets and jackets, protective attire!
Don't dawdle, oh, come quick, before they expire!
You must save my pets, 'cuz the house is on fire!
===
left: WorkHarder.jpg
A sign in my gym all the way at the back
with solid white writing and background in black,
alongside the bikes and electronic stairs,
in very large lettering "Nobody Cares".

Encouraging language to keep you on track,
a mantra of power, "Go! Firmly attack!
It isn't enough to just plan your day smarter!
You're here to be stronger, so push and Work Harder."
===
left: IkeaWardrobe.jpg
Ikea wardrobe, pulled apart,
and laid against the wall as art.
It occupies visual space,
a white particle board showcase.

Soon I'll sell it to a buyer,
or maybe give if need is dire.

Oops, a piece broke. I glued the crack.
They'll never know. It's in the back. :)
===
top: BrandyMelville1.jpg[300], BrandyMelville2.jpg[300]
I don't know Brandy Melville,
but her tote bag cards are stacked.
Or maybe it's some St George ads,
and Brandy's on the back.
Or maybe they're a lover's mark--
Brandy plus Melville, true amour.
Left in the fence around a park
to tell you of their favorite store.

Happy Birthday, so they say!
You woke up! It's a brand new day!
The sunlight glows through gauzy curtains.
The day ahead's not set for certain!
Good morning! Good morning!
An expression of joy.
The universe beckons!
Get moving, cowboy!
Your friends have been waiting!
There's life to be done!
Memory creating!
Enjoying each one!

When greeting, when leaving,
in morning, in evening,
not timely, just feelings
'bout seeing someone.

Good morning. Good morning.
Happy birthday.

Three coins catch the corner of my eye.
Quarter, quarter, dime, how'd you get there little guys?
Shining shyly from a pile of leaves,
tucked into a crevice underneath a shady tree.

Maybe someone put you there to grow?
"Money grows on trees" is how I think the saying goes?
Or is that backwards? I don't really know.
Maybe they're a secret stash forgotten long ago?
Or if the tree was trusted, it could hold them in escrow?

I think they look like they've been here some time.
And I say now you're mine, little quarters, little dime.
I'll pocket you and walk with you and clean off all your grime.
It's rescuing, not stealing. Surely that's no glaring crime.

And when I go out roaming next I'm sure I'll see a sign.
That all the time I spent with you was good use of my feet.
Like at the coffee shop there is a tip jar by the line.
And that's a better endpoint than the street.
===
left: Dollar.jpg
I found a dirty dollar on the ground.
I guess it's kinda fortunate that I was looking down.
It's not enough to buy a coffee now,
but every one I find just gets me closer to the line
of lifting up the weight that bends my crown.
A tiny bit, but still it counts somehow?
This ragged bill, with little grace, unexpectedly misplaced,
abandoned on its grimy face and sitting in this filthy space,
until I find it, pick it, pocket,
transport, carry, escort, walk it
home to wash it, dry it, lay it...
And one day soon I'll spend or pay it.

Summer fling with a beautiful woman--
talking 'til dawn, borrowed kisses, park benches, holding hands.

This mustn't last long, says the beautiful woman.
We cannot go on, says the beautiful woman.
It's terribly wrong, says the beautiful woman.

My man's coming home, says the beautiful woman,
and there's a good chance that he won't understand.
===
It's weird, you know, to feel so close.
How does this make any sense?
We've only met just now, and yet,
the conversation's immense.

We talk and talk and talk some more,
I never get tired, you never get bored.
Two hours go by, then three, then four.
It never feels like fulfilling a chore.

I'll be sad when it's in the past tense.
===
Plant a pickle, grow a pickle, take a pickle, owe a pickle.
Eat a pickle, slurp a pickle, smoke a pickle, blow a pickle. *
Slice a pickle on the table with a scalpel, surgeon's practice.
Put a pickle in a pot of sandy soil, prickless cactus.
Whisper secrets to a pickle, cold and green and wetly glistening.
Pickle doesn't care what you said, not so very good at listening.

* - This line is sex euphemisms, and I think that's very funny.
===
Two monkeys dance a wild tango
'round the jungle, hither yon,
together faster than they can go
alone through the Amazon.
They crash right through some prickly bushes,
gallup off a precipice.
Sprawling, falling, cold wind rushes
in their ears, all hope is gone.
They should have looked where they were going,
but the monkeys won't be missed.
===
I sit here eating a burrito,
wondering why it looks pink.
My stomach churns, I feel uneasy.
Suddenly extremely queasy,
I barely make it, not so easy,
to throw it all up in the sink.
===
As I queue here at the bank,
my mind goes roaming like the tank
that, stolen, rampaged San Diego,
mashed some cars like baked potatos,
knocked down poles and fire hydrants,
back in 1995.

The thief, they said a jobless plumber,
grabbed the craft and pulled a runner
down the streets on top of traffic,
smashing, crashing, wreaking havoc,
to run amok ignoring sirens
on the last day of his life.

So, anyway, I stand and wait,
and as I do I contemplate
the lives of folks and all their capers
that get their names in all the papers.

And with my musings here in line,
it seems to me that Michael Jackson
dangling his baby Blanket
from the balcony on four
did not ever stop to think
about all of the media stink
at little Jr on the brink
of reaching abruptly the floor.
