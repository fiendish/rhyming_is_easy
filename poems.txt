At seamarket there is a stall
I visit every time.
The woman sells this jerkied pork
with garlic, pepper, fish, and lime.

The listed price is 35
per pound of belly meat
that has been sliced, seasoned, and fried,
and dried into a crispy treat.

She reaches in a hulking bin
and scoops onto a scale
a mound of meaty mortal sin,
and then her son completes the sale.

I like to keep it icy cold
to add some extra crunch
that amplifies the joy tenfold
and turns it from a snack to lunch.

Little golden naked man,
reaching out his empty hand,
palm turned up, looks like he's begging
for a pair of winter leggings.

Details make him appear frigid:
penis shrunken, nipples rigid,
arms are stiffened, legs are too.
Probably his skin's gone blue.

Won't you save him from distress,
keep him from frost's chill caress,
undo/redress cold undress?
God bless, I guess.
===
left: CafeBook.jpg
I'm sitting at a cafe with a book
from a friend I don't want to stop thinking about,
a friend with whom I'd love to laugh and cook
but currently I'm trying to spend time without.

I'm worried somewhat about the connection
between bouts of loneliness and how much time we'd spend
engaging in our happy intersection
and my discontentment when our conversations end.

And so I'm taking time out of my day
to sit and read this book outside my neighborhood cafe
and enjoy it for its own sake not because it came from them
so we can go back, hopefully, to being close again.

Maybe this is asinine. Don't know.
My sign it's time to disentwine and grow.
Assign divine design, recline, let go.
That vulpine smile though. (don't be crass)

Lemonade and cookies too--
buck per small one, two for double.
But no kids or snacks in view.
Hope they didn't get in trouble.

Selling food without approval
could get them a hefty fine,
also physical removal
if they refused to resign.

Disappointment scribed in ink,
menu purple, blue, and black.
I would really like a drink.
Hopefully they're coming back.

Heavenly Healing on mall lower level,
PA's largest metaphysical store.
Incense and candles to enthrall the devil,
crystals, massage, carvings, workshops, and more.

Went to the website to read testimonials:
"Love magnet kit worked immediately.
Root chakra tincture made husband quite jovial
after I dabbed it perineally."

Get a free crystal when you book your first class
as an enticement to sign up online.
Selenite missile to stick inside your ass,
has no flared base, but, don't worry, it's fine.
===
left: LittleTrees.jpg
I think this tree is growing little trees,
with shoots and leaves that rise and brush my knees.
The root projects extensions disconcertingly.
Are trees just branches that were sprouted vertically?

What happens if they continue to grow
and never turn or bend at an elbow?
Can they elongate rapidly
and rise up to an apogee
that punches through the canopy
and escapes the earth's gravity?
It seems unlikely that I'll ever know.
===
top: Lasers.jpg[600]
Since sudden summer's storms sonorously spread serenity across smouldering skies,
in shade beneath softened sunlight now splashing surrenderingly not scorchingly,

I sit, spying, sidelong, surreptitiously, smirking slightly with just my eyes,
as a stream of small sons stomps along, siblings certainly, in society or sanguinity,

striding, spinning, sauntering, to survey a spread of string, stretched across the grass,
crisscrossing, laced, spanning and splitting the space, a strewn simulacrum of--"LASERS! SAM!"

Sneaking, but in opposite of silence, shouting, smiling, "I'm stuck! I can't pass!",
seven scions successively step and straddle the slots in sequence, strand by sizzling strand.

(no images for this yet, but I'll fix that soon)

Some parts of this city I really adore,
but other parts I cannot help but deplore
for being unloved and un-cared-for eyesores
against whom the city appears to wage war.
The parts of the city where people are poor
are left to decay and avoided by tours,
neglected, abandoned, with boarded up doors,
no trees on the street, vandal tags for decor,
just pawn shops and junk food and check cashing stores.
The stark subdivisions are hard to ignore
between parts with less and the parts with much more.
So sometimes I ask myself when feeling sore,
do I love Philly as much as before?

And yet when I walk there's no end to the nice parts
away from the empty lots, garbage, and Walmart.
It feels like on each block there's some kind of fine art,
a mural, mosaic, or sculpture to impart
a vision of what we desire to be
if one day we struggle less with poverty,
a park over here shading benches with trees,
a pool over there, people swimming for free,
a cat in a windowsill naps languidly,
and thrift stores and pho shops with noodles and tea,
and strangers on dog walks nod smiling at me,
and neighborhood gardens abundant with blooms
are filling the air with sweet honey perfumes,
and parents with drinks watching children with chalk
drawing cute diagrams on the sidewalk.

I wander for months and the joy never ends,
so why am I only attached to my friends?

Is it my mentality?
My modality?
My tonality?
Duality in my capacity for vivacity?
Is it the city, or is it me?

The Long Island Rail Road from Bayside to Penn

it whisks you away to the heart of Manhattan
in long metal chains of commuter train cabins.

but if you don't use the pass you're out of luck,
the fee to refund it's a whopping ten bucks.

The signs say no standing on poles down the street.
But standing means sitting in the driver's seat.
The rule's against cars occupying the road,
not humans on legs in a statuesque mode.
It tells of the car's, not the driver's position.
And stopping your wheels needs D.O.T.'s permission.

In the museum surrounded by glass,
eight solid pillars for plugging your ass. (hah)

Grind them down, maybe, then wear them with pride,

"Hey, we're kinda mad now."

No waste pickup for a week,
dumpsters placed that all may seek.
Populace chimes in critique,
"We don't want to scab now."

Garbage bringers come at night,

City hall curbed their appeals.

Lots of noise and lots of dust.
Ineffective 'lectric gusts.

Sweeping would be done by now.

top: Ficus.jpg[600]
It is funny that most ficus make a fig you should not eat,
like a photo of an ice cube in the searing summer heat.
It reminds you of the nice fruit filled with gobs of tiny seeds,
but most fruiting feral ficus lack the sugar to be sweet.

So if you pass a planter when you're walking down the street,
and you think, "If that were edible, it truly would be neat,"
best evaluate assumptions about visual deceit;
almost certainly its species isn't gonna be a treat.

Do you ever look at a sign on a pole
and think, "Can anyone do that?
Can I grant myself the rulemaker's role

the change was made officially
or by a neighbor feeling clever.

The cackling sun melts the sky.
The exhausted earth heaves, unwilling, out of breath.
And the people under parasols crawl from shadow to furious shadow, asking why,
as the conflagration of a midsummer's day offers sweltering death.

The cats twitch in dream as passersby
peer longingly at the windowsills where they ignore the street.
A lone man smears salty rivers of sweat into his eyes,
thirsting for conditioned interlude from this murderous heat.

"A cloud, a cloud, oh thank you, a cloud",
weary walkers, prostrating themselves to cumulus change,
stare into the glare and declare to their friends out loud,
newly prepared for hopefully impending rain.

Is its denunciation not defamation?
Are we discouraged by its desecration?

Half way up the staircase, he

So I walk over to see
the cause of his crying plea.

When I say his name, he
looks the wrong way and sees
no one at the top and
thinks he just can't see me.

Then I call him again, and he swings his head around,
sees me standing on the landing nearer to the ground,
looks back up and then back down again until his eyes
recognize my visage which he notes with some surprise.

His face lights up, "Oh, hey! You're there!
How'd you get past me on the stairs?
I heard you up, but now you're down.
I guess my senses turned around!"

I say "I know, there's no brain there.

Three coins catch the corner of my eye.
Quarter, quarter, dime, how'd you get there little guys?
Shining shyly from a pile of leaves,
tucked into a crevice underneath a shady tree.

Maybe someone put you there to grow?
"Money grows on trees" is how I think the saying goes?
Or is that backwards? I don't really know.
Maybe they're a secret stash forgotten long ago?
Or if the tree was trusted, it could hold them in escrow?

I think they look like they've been here some time.
And I say now you're mine, little quarters, little dime.
I'll pocket you and walk with you and clean off all your grime.
It's rescuing, not stealing. Surely that's no glaring crime.

And when I go out roaming next I'm sure I'll see a sign.
That all the time I spent with you was good use of my feet.
Like at the coffee shop there is a tip jar by the line.
And that's a better endpoint than the street.

I found a dirty dollar on the ground.
I guess it's kinda fortunate that I was looking down.
It's not enough to buy a coffee now,
but every one I find just gets me closer to the line
of lifting up the weight that bends my crown.
A tiny bit, but still it counts somehow?
This ragged bill, with little grace, unexpectedly misplaced,
abandoned on its grimy face and sitting in this filthy space,
until I find it, pick it, pocket,
transport, carry, escort, walk it
home to wash it, dry it, lay it...
And one day soon I'll spend or pay it.

Summer fling with a beautiful woman--

Two hours go by, then three, then four.
It never feels like fulfilling a chore.

Suddenly extremely queasy,

As I queue here at the bank,
my mind goes roaming like the tank
that, stolen, rampaged San Diego,
mashed some cars like baked potatos,
knocked down poles and fire hydrants,
back in 1995.

The thief, they said a jobless plumber,
grabbed the craft and pulled a runner
down the streets on top of traffic,
smashing, crashing, wreaking havoc,
to run amok ignoring sirens
on the last day of his life.

So, anyway, I stand and wait,
and as I do I contemplate
the lives of folks and all their capers
that get their names in all the papers.

And with my musings here in line,
it seems to me that Michael Jackson
dangling his baby Blanket
from the balcony on four
did not ever stop to think
about all of the media stink
at little Jr on the brink
of reaching abruptly the floor.
