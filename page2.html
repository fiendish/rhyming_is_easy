  <pre>Metal cat, metal cat, 
what the heck you staring at
perched high up the 'lectric pole
in a fetching turquoise stole?

Trees behind you show right through 
your body made of curlicues.
I wish you looked down at the street 
I like your face more than your feet.</pre>

  <pre>Near South and Broad there is a wall
of Mural Arts causation.
A lion's face, a drill, a clock,
a scroll of divination.

The I Ching runs behind a wheel
and passersby can reach and spin
to let the future unconceal
the best way for them to begin.

We stop, we read, we make our bets
about which guidance we'll each get.
I spin it thrice, and, at the mark,
I hit the night, the hat, the dark.</pre>

  <pre>Come learn about economics,
gender norms, and microphonics,
books, zines, wires, and anarchy.

Not questionable, Iffy.

Call whomever, share the glee,
their payphone says, laconically,
projecting generosity:

"Donations only. All calls free."</pre>

  <pre>Sun-sprinkled scintillant speckles strewn astride a shining grin.
Dazzling dancing diaphanous freckles dot your delicate dappled skin.
Laughing eyes behind dark glasses gaze at me uncertainly
and curiously try to assess what it is that my eyes see.</pre>

It shines signs on your face, "Good morning. Happy Birthday."</pre>

  <pre>My cat's a little dummy,
brain squishy like a gummy.
He's got a fluffy tummy,
but
his hearing's pretty crummy.

Half way up the staircase, he
calls out loud to locate me.
So I walk over to see
the cause of his crying plea.

When I say his name, he
looks the wrong way and sees
no one at the top and
thinks he just can't see me.

Then I call him again, and he swings his head around,
sees me standing on the landing nearer to the ground,
looks back up and then back down again until his eyes
recognize my visage which he notes with some surprise.

His face lights up, "Oh, hey! You're there!
How'd you get past me on the stairs?
I heard you up, but now you're down.
I guess my senses turned around!"

I say "I know, there's no brain there.
Your head is filled with fluff and air.
It makes you super sweet and true.
It's ok though, I love you too."</pre>
