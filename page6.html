  <pre>I found a dirty dollar on the ground.
I guess it's kinda fortunate that I was looking down.
It's not enough to buy a coffee now,
but every one I find just gets me closer to the line
of lifting up the weight that bends my crown.
A tiny bit, but still it counts somehow?
This ragged bill, with little grace, unexpectedly misplaced,
abandoned on its grimy face and sitting in this filthy space,
until I find it, pick it, pocket,
transport, carry, escort, walk it
home to wash it, dry it, lay it...
And one day soon I'll spend or pay it.</pre>

  <pre>Summer fling with a beautiful woman--
talking 'til dawn, borrowed kisses, park benches, holding hands.

This mustn't last long, says the beautiful woman.
We cannot go on, says the beautiful woman.
It's terribly wrong, says the beautiful woman.

My man's coming home, says the beautiful woman,
and there's a good chance that he won't understand.</pre>

  <pre>It's weird, you know, to feel so close.
How does this make any sense?
We've only met just now, and yet,
the conversation's immense.

We talk and talk and talk some more,
I never get tired, you never get bored.
Two hours go by, then three, then four.
It never feels like fulfilling a chore.

I'll be sad when it's in the past tense.</pre>

  <pre>Plant a pickle, grow a pickle, take a pickle, owe a pickle.
Eat a pickle, slurp a pickle, smoke a pickle, blow a pickle. *
Slice a pickle on the table with a scalpel, surgeon's practice.
Put a pickle in a pot of sandy soil, prickless cactus.
Whisper secrets to a pickle, cold and green and wetly glistening.
Pickle doesn't care what you said, not so very good at listening.

* - This line is sex euphemisms, and I think that's very funny.</pre>

  <pre>Two monkeys dance a wild tango
'round the jungle, hither yon,
together faster than they can go
alone through the Amazon.
They crash right through some prickly bushes,
gallup off a precipice.
Sprawling, falling, cold wind rushes
in their ears, all hope is gone.
They should have looked where they were going,
but the monkeys won't be missed.</pre>
